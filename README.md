## Usage
### Input
Accepted input is a WKT-string of the Geometry that should be plotted. A layer is created for each plotted object. To see the exact coordinates for a Layer, select the Layer in the list to the right (by clicking on it), and hover over the points that appear on the selected objects.

Supported Geometry-classes are:
- Polygon
- Point
- LineString
- GeometryCollection
- MultiPolygon
- MultiPoint
- MultiLineString

### Layers
Layers can be moved up and down. This is done by selecting one or more layers in the list to the right and using the up- and down-buttons on your keyboard. You may also select multiple layers by holding in the Ctrl-button while clicking on the layers. A group of layers may also be moved with the up and down keyboard buttons.

A layer may be hidden by unchecking the checkbox to the left of the layer's name.

### Zooming
Zooming is done by clicking the plus (+) or minus (-) keyboard buttons, or by scrolling up or down while the mouse is in the graphics area.
